The PDF Content Converter is a tool for converting PDF text as well as structural features into a pandas dataframe, written natively in Python.
It retrieves information about textual content, fonts, positions, character frequencies and surrounding visual PDF elements.

How-to
========

* Pass the path of the PDF file which is wanted to be converted to ``PDFContentConverter``.

* Call the function ``pdf2pandas()``. The PDF content is then returned as a pandas dataframe.

* Media boxes of a PDF can be accessed using ``get_media_boxes()``, the page count over ``get_page_count()`` and the document text using ``pdf2text()``.

* Using the ``convert()`` function, the pandas dataframe, textual document content, media boxes and page count are returned as a dictionary.

Example call: 

	converter = PDFContentConverter(pdf)

	result = converter.pdf2pandas()

Output Format
===============

The output containing the converted PDF data is stored as pandas dataframe.

The different PDF elements are stored as rows.

The dataframe contains the following columns:

* ``id``: unique identifier of the PDF element

* ``page``: page number, starting with 0

* ``text``: text of the PDF element

* ``x_0``: left x coordinate

* ``x_1``: right x coordinate

* ``y_0``: top y coordinate

* ``y_1``: bottom y coordinate

* ``pos_x``: center x coordinate

* ``pos_y``: center y coordinate

* ``abs_pos``: tuple containing a page independent representation of ``(pos_x,pos_y)`` coordinates

* ``original_font``: font as extracted by pdfminer

* ``font_name``: name of the font extracted from ``original_font``

* ``code``: font code as provided by pdfminer

* ``bold``: factor 1 indicating that a text is bold and 0 otherwise

* ``italic``: factor 1 indicating that a text is italic and 0 otherwise

* ``font_size``: size of the text in points

* ``masked``: text with numeric content substituted as #

* ``frequency_hist``: histogram of character type frequencies in a text, stored as a tuple containing percentages of textual, numerical, text symbolic and other symbols

* ``len_text``: number of characters

* ``n_tokens``: number of words

* ``tag``: tag for key-value pair extractions, indicating keys or values based on simple heuristics

* ``box``: box extracted by pdfminer Layout Analysis

* ``in_element_ids``: contains IDs of surrounding visual elements such as rectangles or lists. They are stored as a list [left, right, top, bottom]. -1 is indicating that there is no adjacent visual element.

* ``in_element``: indicates based on in*element_ids whether an element is stored in a visual rectangle representation (stored as "rectangle") or not (stored as "none").

Additionally, a dictionary is returned  containing the following entries,

which can be used to transform the absolute CSV coordinates:

* ``x0``: Left x page crop box coordinate

* ``x1``: Right x page crop box coordinate

* ``y0``: Top y page crop box coordinate

* ``y1``: Bottom y page crop box coordinate

* ``x0page``: Left x page coordinate

* ``x1page``: Right x page coordinate

* ``y0page``: Top y page coordinate

* ``y1page``: Bottom y page coordinate

Both are returned in a dictionary when using ``convert()``. 

The dataframe is stored as "content", the page characteristics as "media_boxes", the textual content as "text" and the number of pages as "page_count".
